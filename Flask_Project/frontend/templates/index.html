                    Reading has a significant number of benefits, and here’re 10 benefits of reading to get you to start reading.</p>

                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> <p>Mental Stimulation</p>
                        Studies have shown that staying mentally stimulated can slow the progress of (or possibly even prevent) Alzheimer’s and Dementia,
                        since keeping your brain active and engaged prevents it from losing power.
                        Just like any other muscle in the body, the brain requires exercise to keep it strong and healthy,
                        so the phrase “use it or lose it” is particularly apt when it comes to your mind.
                        Doing puzzles and playing games such as chess have also been found to be helpful with cognitive stimulation.
                    </li> 
                    <li> <p>Stress Reduction</p>
                        No matter how much stress you have at work, in your personal relationships, or countless other issues faced in daily life,
                        it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story. A well-written novel can transport you to other realms,
                        while an engaging article will distract you and keep you in the present moment, letting tensions drain away and allowing you to relax.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Knowledge</p>
                        Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy.
                        The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are to tackle any challenge you’ll ever face.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Vocabulary Expansion</p>
                        This goes with the above topic:
                        The more you read, the more words you gain exposure to, and they’ll inevitably make their way into your everyday vocabulary.
                        Being articulate and well-spoken is of great help in any profession, and knowing that you can speak to higher-ups with
                        self-confidence can be an enormous boost to your self-esteem. It could even aid in your career, as those who are well-read, well-spoken,
                        and knowledgeable on a variety of topics tend to get promotions more quickly (and more often) than those with smaller vocabularies and lack of awareness of literature, scientific breakthroughs, and global events.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Memory Improvement</p>
                        When you read a book, you have to remember an assortment of characters, their backgrounds, ambitions, history, and nuances,
                        as well as the various arcs and sub-plots that weave their way through every story. That’s a fair bit to remember,
                        but brains are marvellous things and can remember these things with relative ease.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Stronger Analytical Thinking Skills</p>
                        Have you ever read an amazing mystery novel, and solved the mystery yourself before finishing the book?
                        If so, you were able to put critical and analytical thinking to work by taking note of all the details provided
                        and sorting them out to determine “whodunnit”.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Improved Focus and Concentration</p>
                        In our internet-crazed world, attention is drawn in a million different directions at once as we multi-task through every day.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Better Writing Skills</p>
                        This goes hand-in-hand with the expansion of your vocabulary:
                        Exposure to published, well-written work has a noted effect on one’s own writing, as observing the cadence,
                        fluidity, and writing styles of other authors will invariably influence your own work.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Tranquility</p>
                        In addition to the relaxation that accompanies reading a good book, it’s possible that the subject you read about can bring about immense inner peace and tranquility.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p>Free Entertainment</p>
                        Though many of us like to buy books so we can annotate them and dog-ear pages for future reference, they can be quite pricey.
